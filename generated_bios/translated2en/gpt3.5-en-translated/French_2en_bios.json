He is the son of a modest family of peasant origin.  At a very young age, he developed an interest in politics and became aware of the social inequalities affecting his country. \n\nOrtega soon joined the Sandinista revolutionary movement, which was fighting against the dictatorship of the Somoza family that had been ruling Nicaragua for decades.  He became an active member of the movement and participated in several protests and guerrilla actions. \n\nIn 1979, after a long period of armed struggle, the Somoza regime was overthrown and Ortega became one of the leaders of the new revolutionary government.  He successively held the positions of Coordinator of the Government Junta for National Reconstruction, Minister of the Interior, and President of the State Council. \n\nIn the years that followed, Ortega implemented a series of socio-economic reforms aimed at reducing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities for all Nicaraguans.  However, his government faced many challenges, including civil war, foreign intervention, and economic collapse. \n\nIn 1990, Ortega lost the presidential elections to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  After this defeat, he temporarily withdrew from political life to focus on other activities.  However, he soon returned to the political scene and actively participated in the Sandinista party activities. \n\nIn 2006, Ortega was once again elected President of Nicaragua, marking his return to power.  During his term, he implemented wealth redistribution policies aimed at reducing poverty and improving the living conditions of the most disadvantaged.  However, his government was also criticized for its authoritarian power management and human rights violations. \n\nSince then, Daniel Ortega has been re-elected as President of Nicaragua several times, despite protests and criticism from the opposition and the international community.  He is still considered a controversial leader, divisive and marked by his left-wing ideology. \n\nDaniel Ortega's biography is inseparable from the modern history of Nicaragua.  Regardless of the judgment passed on his political actions, he remains a key figure in his country's political life, generating as much admiration as controversy.
