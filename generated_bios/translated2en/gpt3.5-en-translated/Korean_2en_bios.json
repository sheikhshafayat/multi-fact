", "John Key": "Here is the translation of the text about Zone Key:\n\nWriting a biography of Zone Key is as follows:\n\nBiography: Zone Key\n1.  Concept: Zone Key is an important concept used to partition or manage base tables in a database system.  In other words, it is a column or set of columns used to partition or join tables for various purposes. \n\n2.  Roles:\n- Table Partitioning: With Zone Key, database tables can be partitioned into multiple zones.  This allows for efficient storage and processing of data.  Each zone can be stored in separate physical spaces and can also be distributed across multiple servers. \n- Join: When joining multiple tables, you can use the Zone Key to retrieve connected data.  This helps establish relationships between tables and allows for comprehensive analysis or querying of data. \n\n3.  Components:\n- Zone Key typically uses the Primary Key column of a table or a major Index column.  Usually, integer or string columns are used. \n- Zone Key columns must have unique values for each record, thus they should be non-duplicate values. \n\n4.  Example:\nFor instance, let's assume there are 'Order' and 'Product' tables in an online shopping mall's database.  In this case, the Zone Key of the 'Order' table could be the OrderID column.  By joining the 'Product' and 'Order' tables based on OrderID, you can retrieve product information corresponding to each order.  Thus, Zone Key can be utilized to establish relationships between tables and integrate data to provide users with useful information. "}
