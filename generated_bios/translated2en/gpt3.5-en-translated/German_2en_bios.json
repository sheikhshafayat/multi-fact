He belongs to the Banyankole ethnic group and grew up in humble circumstances.  His parents were farmers who mainly produced for their own sustenance. \n\nMuseveni was born during a time when Uganda was still a British colony.  He received his education in local missionary schools and developed an early interest in politics and social issues.  During his school years, he was already politically active, advocating for the rights of the Banyankole and other indigenous communities. \n\nIn 1967, Museveni enrolled at the University of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, where he studied political science.  Here, he came into contact with other African revolutionaries and was inspired by Marxist-Leninist ideas.  During his studies, he founded the Ugandan Students' Movement and was heavily involved in the anti-imperialist movement. \n\nAfter completing his studies, Museveni returned to Uganda in 1970 and joined the Uganda People's Congress (UPC).  Under the leadership of President Milton Obote, the UPC played a crucial role in Uganda's independence and was the dominant political force in the country at that time.  Museveni quickly rose through the ranks of the UPC and was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense in 1979. \n\nHowever, Museveni became a critic of Obote's government.  He believed that the government was too corrupt and did not adequately protect the rights of the population.  This discontent eventually led to the founding of the National Resistance Army (NRA) in 1980, a rebel movement that aimed to overthrow Obote's government. \n\nIn the following years, Museveni led a successful guerrilla war against Obote's troops.  His movement gained wide support from the population, who were tired of the government's corruption and abuse.  In 1986, Museveni finally managed to overthrow Obote and take control of the country. \n\nSince assuming power in 1986, Museveni has been the President of Uganda.  He promised to bring stability, economic progress, and democracy to the country.  During his tenure, Museveni has made some progress, such as improving infrastructure, access to education and healthcare, and strengthening the economy.  However, there have been allegations of corruption, political freedoms restrictions, and human rights abuses under his government. \n\nDespite these controversies, Museveni continues to hold onto the presidency to this day.  He has been reelected multiple times, albeit facing increasing resistance from opposition parties and activists.  Museveni's government remains active and continues to polarize Ugandan society. \n\nYoweri Museveni is considered one of the most prominent political figures in Uganda's history.
