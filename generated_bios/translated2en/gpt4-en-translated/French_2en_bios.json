{"Xi Jinping": "Xi Jinping is a Chinese politician who has been serving as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, the President of the People's Republic of China since 2013, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, thus becoming the top leader of China.  He is often seen as one of the most powerful leaders in modern Chinese history since Mao Zedong. \n\nBorn on June 15, 1953, in Beijing, Xi comes from a family with close ties to the Chinese communist revolution.  His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary veteran and an important figure in the Communist Party.  However, during the Cultural Revolution, Xi Jinping experienced a difficult youth when his father was purged, and he himself was sent to the countryside for \"re-education through labor\" as a member of the Red Guards.  He lived in a village in the Shaanxi province, where he did manual labor. \n\nHe then started his studies at Tsinghua University, where he obtained a Ph. D.  in law and Marxist ideology.  His political career began in the 1980s.  He quickly rose through the party ranks in the provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and finally Shanghai before being promoted at the national level. \n\nElected General Secretary of the Communist Party in November 2012, Xi Jinping launched a series of reforms aiming to centralize power in his hands and combat corruption, an initiative that led to the downfall of many high-ranking officials.  At the same time, he promoted the \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" an infrastructure project aimed at enhancing connectivity and economic cooperation between China and other countries in various regions around the world. \n\nUnder his leadership, the Chinese government has also strengthened censorship and media control, as well as citizen surveillance.  He has also defended China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, sometimes leading to tensions with neighbors and foreign powers. \n\nIn 2018, presidential term limits were removed, allowing Xi to remain in power beyond the previously set two five-year terms.  This decision was seen as a sign of his increased power and desire to lead China indefinitely. \n\nXi Jinping has played a key role in shaping Chinese economic policy, aiming to maintain the country's economic growth while addressing challenges of modernization, rising inequalities, and environmental issues. \n\nWith an ambitious foreign policy, he has sought to position China as a major global power while managing complex relationships with the United States and other nations.  His presidency is characterized by strengthened nationalism, consolidation of personal power, and stricter control over society and the economy.

Before becoming Prime Minister, he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014. \n\nModi was born and raised in a family of tea sellers from the Ganchi caste, traditionally considered a lower caste in Indian society.  He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Delhi and a Master of Arts from the University of Gujarat.  In his youth, Modi was an activist in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist paramilitary organization.  He later joined the BJP, and his political career progressed rapidly within the party. \n\nAs Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi implemented policies to encourage economic growth and private investment.  He was credited with transforming the economy of Gujarat, but was also criticized for his handling of the 2002 riots in Gujarat, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.  Modi denied any responsibility, and in 2012, an inquiry supervised by the Supreme Court found no evidence to prosecute Modi. \n\nHis victory in the 2014 election as Prime Minister was historic, as the BJP secured an absolute majority in parliament, a first in 30 years in the country.  Under Modi, the Indian government launched numerous economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the Indian economy, including the implementation of a goods and services tax system and various initiatives to promote digitization and modernization of infrastructure. \n\nHis foreign policy, often described as pragmatic, aims to strengthen ties with major countries around the world, and he is a strong advocate of multilateralism.  Modi is also known for his use of social media to communicate with the public. \n\nHowever, his second term, which began in 2019, has been marked by controversy, notably due to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act, seen as discriminatory towards Muslims, and the revocation of Article 370, ending the special autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir. \n\nDespite being a divisive figure, Modi remains a highly influential political figure in India, with his popularity largely supported by his efforts to promote a sense of Hindu nationalism and his image as a pragmatic and results-oriented leader.

With the support of the PML-N, which at the time had the majority in the National Assembly after the 2013 general elections, Hussain was elected President of Pakistan. \n\nAs president, Mamnoon Hussain's role was primarily ceremonial due to the parliamentary structure of the Pakistani government where executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister.  Nevertheless, as head of state, he played a role in promoting national unity and represented Pakistan on the international stage. \n\nHis tenure as president was relatively quiet and without major political incidents.  He continued the policy of presidential neutrality and served his full term until September 2018, after which he retired from active politics. \n\nMamnoon Hussain passed away on July 14, 2021, at the age of 80 after a battle with cancer.

She was educated at the University of Dhaka, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in history and a master's degree in philosophy. \n\nHer life was marked by tragedy when most of her family, including her father, mother, and three brothers, were assassinated during a military coup on August 15, 1975.  Hasina was abroad at that time, which likely saved her life.  She went into exile in India until her return to Bangladesh in 1981. \n\nUpon her return, she quickly assumed leadership of the Awami League and became a prominent opposition figure against the successive military regimes that ruled the country after her father's assassination.  Sheikh Hasina campaigned for a return to democracy and was arrested multiple times for her activities. \n\nHasina was first elected Prime Minister of Bangladesh in 1996, and her government was credited with numerous economic and social improvements, although her time in power was also marked by accusations of corruption.

This political lineage certainly played a role in Shinzo Abe's career. \n\nAbe studied political science at Seikei University in Tokyo before continuing his studies in the United States at the University of Southern California.  Upon returning to Japan, he worked in the steel industry with Kobe Steel Ltd before following in his family's footsteps in politics. \n\nHe was first elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in 1993, representing the Yamaguchi Prefecture.

However, due to health issues and various scandals affecting his cabinet, he resigned in September 2007, after only one year in office. \n\nHe made a political comeback and was re-elected as Prime Minister in December 2012.  During his second term, he was known for his economic policy known as \"Abenomics,\" which aimed to revitalize the stagnant Japanese economy through a mix of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and structural reforms.  His administration was also marked by a firm stance on foreign and defense policy, particularly in response to the rise of China and tensions with North Korea. \n\nShinzo Abe emphasized constitutional revisionism, advocating for an amendment to Japan's pacifist constitution to allow for an expansion of the country's military capabilities in a \"proactive defense\" perspective.  Despite these controversial efforts, he did not succeed in formally amending Japan's pacifist constitution during his term. \n\nHis political longevity allowed him to become the longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan in terms of consecutive days in power.  However, he announced his resignation in August 2020 for health reasons, specifically issues related to chronic ulcerative colitis. \n\nOn July 8, 2022, during a political event in Nara, Shinzo Abe tragically passed away after being shot by a gunman.

As a founding member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdo\u011fan has been a central figure in Turkish politics since the 1990s. \n\nBorn on February 26, 1954, in Istanbul, Erdo\u011fan grew up in a modest neighborhood of the city.  He studied at the Istanbul School of Business but was influenced by politics from a young age.  He became involved in Islamist and nationalist movements in Turkey, which at the time were in opposition to the strict secularism imposed by the Kemalist legacy. \n\nHe was first elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994 under the banner of the Welfare Party (RP), an Islamist party.  His term as mayor was marked by effective reforms in municipal services, but in 1998, after he recited a poem considered to incite religious hatred, he was sentenced to prison, which forced him to resign from his position as mayor. \n\nUpon his release from prison, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and other reformist members of the dissolved RP founded the AKP in 2001, a party that sought to present itself as pro-European, democratic, and moderately Islamist, seeking a synthesis between traditional Turkish values and modernization. \n\nIn 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a landslide victory in the elections, allowing Erdo\u011fan to become Prime Minister in 2003, after a change in legislation lifted the ban that had been imposed on him due to his previous conviction. \n\nDuring his term as Prime Minister, Turkey experienced significant economic growth while beginning accession negotiations with the European Union.

He pursued higher education in the United States, obtaining a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Anthropology from the American University of Beirut.  He later earned a Ph. D.  from the prestigious Columbia University. \n\nAfter his studies, Ashraf Ghani joined the World Bank as an anthropologist and economist, working on projects aimed at improving living conditions in developing countries.  During his time at the World Bank and through other international institutions, Ghani gained a reputation as an effective technocrat and was involved in post-conflict reconstruction in several countries. \n\nFollowing the events of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Ghani returned to his homeland to participate in the reconstruction efforts.  He held various high-level positions, including serving as a finance advisor to interim President Hamid Karzai, and later becoming the Chancellor of Kabul University. \n\nIn 2009, Ghani entered politics by running for the presidential election, although he did not gain significant traction.  However, in his second attempt in 2014, he won the controversial presidential election, marked by allegations of fraud that required a UN-supervised audit.  Eventually, Ghani took office after reaching a power-sharing agreement with his rival Abdullah Abdullah. \n\nDuring his tenure, he focused on improving security, strengthening the economy, combating corruption, and reconciling with the Taliban.  Despite peace efforts, armed conflicts continued, and the Taliban maintained a strong presence in various parts of the country. \n\nGhani's second term began in 2019 after another controversial election.  Peace talks between the United States, the Taliban, and the Afghan government intensified, but no notable success was achieved in reaching a lasting agreement. \n\nAfghanistan's security situation deteriorated rapidly after the withdrawal of US and NATO forces in 2021.  The Taliban launched a swift offensive that led to the fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021.  Ghani left Afghanistan as the Taliban entered the city, a decision he later justified as an attempt to avoid bloodshed. \n\nGhani's departure was widely criticized both within the Afghan population and by the international community, and his legacy remains controversial.  After resigning, Ghani went into exile in the United Arab Emirates.  Since then, he has defended his actions as president and stated that his departure was aimed at preventing a greater tragedy.

Born on December 31, 1935, he is the son of the founder of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud, and his sixth wife, Hassa bint Ahmed al Sudairi.  Salman is his father's 25th son. \n\nHis youth was marked by traditional Saudi education, where he became familiar with religion, science, Arabic literature, as well as learning from the kingdom's governments and administrators. \n\nSalman began his political career by becoming the governor of Riyadh in 1954 at the age of 19, a position he held for nearly five decades.  During this time, he was credited with transforming Riyadh from a modest city into a modern metropolis.  His administration was also known for economic reforms and infrastructure projects that contributed to the capital's development. \n\nIn 2011, after the death of his brother Nayef, Salman was appointed Minister of Defense.  In this role, he oversaw the Saudi armed forces and was responsible for significant arms acquisitions to enhance the kingdom's military power. \n\nFollowing the death of King Abdullah in January 2015, Salman ascended to the throne at the age of 79.  His reign has been marked by several significant changes both domestically and internationally, including ambitious economic reforms under Vision 2030, a plan aimed at reducing the country's reliance on oil revenues and diversifying its economy. \n\nOn the international stage, he has managed often complex relationships with Western allies, particularly the United States, and has led a coalition of Arab countries in the conflict in Yemen, a controversial military intervention launched in 2015. \n\nDespite facing several health issues over the years, Salman continues to lead the kingdom, often relying on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), his son, who has taken on an increasingly central role in governing the country, including cracking down on dissent and implementing social reforms such as granting women the right to drive. \n\nUnder Salman, politics is a balancing act between maintaining Saudi Arabia's traditions and conservative values while trying to modernize and diversify the economy.  However, his reign has also been criticized in terms of human rights, particularly following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, a crime for which Saudi agents were held responsible, tarnishing the kingdom's image. \n\nAs of the writing of this text, Salman continues to rule, although international attention is increasingly focused on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a rising figure in Saudi politics and a possible future king.

Karimov grew up in an orphanage before being raised by adoptive parents. \n\nKarimov first studied at the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute where he received a degree in mechanical engineering, and then at the Tashkent Institute of Economics, where he studied economics.  After graduating, he worked in various industries and held several managerial positions in the Soviet economic apparatus of Uzbekistan. \n\nHe began his political career as a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), rising through the ranks to become the leader of the Party in Uzbekistan in 1989.  When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Karimov was well positioned to take control of the new independent state of Uzbekistan.  He was elected president of Uzbekistan in the republic's first presidential elections in December 1991, and was sworn in on March 24, 1992. \n\nKarimov was known for his authoritarian regime.  Under his leadership, Uzbekistan was criticized for its human rights violations, including torture, arbitrary detentions, and repression of civil liberties.  His economic policy was based on strict state control, although there were some attempts at economic reforms and attracting foreign investments. \n\nInternationally, he pursued a policy of non-alignment, cooperating with both Western powers such as the United States and the European Union, as well as with Russia and China, while keeping some distance from each.  After the September 11, 2001 attacks, he allowed the U. S.  military to use the Karshi-Khanabad air base for operations in Afghanistan, although this cooperation was later suspended. \n\nKarimov was re-elected president several times, often with overwhelming official support, although the elections were widely viewed as not free and fair by international observers.  His longevity in power made him one of the most enduring leaders in the post-Soviet region. \n\nIslam Karimov passed away on September 2, 2016, after suffering a brain hemorrhage.  His death marked the end of an era in Uzbekistan and opened a period of transition and potential political renewal in the country.

", "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi": "Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi is a Yemeni politician born on September 1, 1945 in the region of Abyan in Yemen.  He served as the President of Yemen from 2012 to 2022, succeeding Ali Abdullah Saleh during the Arab Spring and as part of a political transition negotiated by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but his authority was contested by the Houthi rebels. \n\nHadi began his military career in the army of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen), a Marxist nation before its unification with North Yemen in 1990.  He was trained in British and Soviet military establishments and rose through the ranks to become a senior officer in the Yemeni army. \n\nAfter the unification of Yemen, Hadi continued his career as a military and politician, holding various positions including Minister of Defense.  In 1994, he played a major role in the civil war that pitted the north against the south of Yemen, which had been militarily unified only four years earlier. \n\nIn 1994, following the civil war, Hadi became the Vice President under the presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh.  He served in this position for nearly two decades.  During his tenure as Vice President, he was considered a rather subdued figure, often overshadowed by Saleh's strong personality. \n\nThe political situation in Yemen drastically changed in 2011 when a series of protests, inspired by the Arab Spring, erupted throughout the country, demanding an end to Saleh's long-standing rule.  Faced with national and international pressure, Saleh eventually agreed to sign an agreement negotiated by the GCC countries, agreeing to transfer power to Hadi. \n\nHadi assumed the interim presidency on November 23, 2011, and was formally elected President for a two-year transition period in a presidential election in February 2012, where he was the sole candidate.  His presidency was meant to pave the way for a new constitution and broader political reforms.  However, the transition period was marked by increasing political instability, armed conflicts, and the rise in power of the Houthi rebels, a Zaidi Shia group from northern Yemen. \n\nIn September 2014, the Houthis took control of the capital, Sanaa, and in January 2015, placed Hadi under house arrest.  He managed to escape to Aden in February 2015, where he rescinded his earlier resignation and declared that he remained the legitimate president of Yemen.  In March 2015, the Houthis advanced towards Aden, forcing Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia. \n\nThe Saudi-led military intervention began in March 2015, in support of Hadi and his government against the Houthis.  Since then, Yemen has been plunged into a devastating civil war, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. \n\nAlthough Hadi is still internationally recognized as the legitimate president of Yemen for much of the civil war, his exiled government has struggled to exert its authority in the face of different factions and the multiple security challenges affecting the country.  In April 2022, Hadi transferred his powers to a new presidential council in an attempt to consolidate unity against the Houthis and revitalize the political process. \n\nHadi's presidency has been marred by accusations of corruption and an inability to establish stability and peace in a deeply divided Yemen.  Power struggles between rival factions, the presence of AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), attacks by the Houthis, the humanitarian crisis, and the cholera epidemic are among the challenges that Hadi and Yemen have been unable to overcome.

He became a party member in 1954 and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of its most respected leaders.  Koirala was primarily known for his role in the struggle for democracy in Nepal, especially during the years when Nepal was under authoritarian rule. \n\nIn the 1990s, when Nepal transitioned to a multi-party democracy, Sushil Koirala played a key role in establishing new democratic institutions in the country.  He also served multiple times as a member of the Nepalese House of Representatives. \n\nSushil Koirala is mainly recognized for being elected as the Prime Minister of Nepal on February 10, 2014.  His tenure was marked by several major challenges, including the process of drafting a new constitution for Nepal.  He led efforts for the new constitution to be adopted, which eventually occurred in September 2015, a significant milestone for the consolidation of Nepalese democracy. \n\nHowever, his tenure was also marked by a major natural disaster, the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, killing nearly 9,000 people and causing massive damage.  His handling of the earthquake aftermath was criticized, with many faulting him for a lack of effectiveness and speed in responding to the needs of the victims. \n\nKoirala was known for his austere and simple lifestyle and was considered a man of integrity.

He is known for being the dominant leader of Russia since the late 1990s, having served as both president and prime minister of the country. \n\nPutin grew up in Leningrad in a working-class family.  After studying law at Leningrad State University, he joined the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service, in 1975.  He had a 16-year career there, mainly in East Germany. \n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, Putin returned to Leningrad and entered politics under the tutelage of the reformist mayor Anatoly Sobchak.  In 1996, he was called to Moscow by President Boris Yeltsin and held various increasingly important administrative positions, eventually becoming head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the KGB. \n\nIn 1999, Putin was appointed prime minister by Yeltsin, who resigned shortly thereafter, allowing Putin to become interim president on December 31, 1999.  He was officially elected president in 2000, and re-elected in 2004.  His first term was marked by economic reforms and a recentralization of power.  Conflicts in Chechnya, as well as his handling of the hostage crisis at a Moscow theater in 2002 and at the Beslan school in 2004, highlighted his sometimes brutal methods and ruthless approach to terrorism. \n\nDue to constitutional limits, Putin could not run for a third consecutive term in 2008.  He orchestrated the election of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dmitry Medvedev, and became prime minister, while remaining the dominant figure in the duo.  In 2012, after a change in the constitution extending presidential terms from four to six years, Putin was re-elected president. \n\nPutin's policy is characterized by his nationalism, control over the media, repression of the opposition, and assertive geopolitical position.  His time in power has seen the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Russian military intervention in Syria in 2015, and involvement in various regional and international conflicts.  His handling of domestic and foreign affairs has led to tensions with Western countries, particularly due to allegations of interference in foreign elections and support for authoritarian regimes. \n\nPutin's popularity in Russia is often attributed to the relative stability after the chaotic years following the fall of the USSR, as well as the reappropriation of natural resources that has boosted economic growth.  However, his regime is criticized for widespread corruption, deterioration of democratic standards, and decline of civil liberties. \n\nIn 2020, constitutional reforms were approved through a national referendum, potentially allowing Putin to remain in power until 2036 if re-elected.  His policies, longevity in power, and means of maintaining order evoke as much admiration as controversy on the international stage.

As a pastor, he was an active member of the Protestant Church, which provided a space for public debate and dissent in a society otherwise dominated by state surveillance. \n\nIn the 1980s, Gauck became increasingly involved in the civil rights movements in the GDR.  He played a role in the creation of the \"Neues Forum,\" a political movement that called for the democratization of the communist regime. \n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the GDR, Joachim Gauck was appointed to lead the authority responsible for the Stasi archives, the East German secret police.

This was the first British coalition since World War II. \n\nAs Prime Minister, Cameron implemented a series of reforms in economic, social, and foreign policy.  He pursued an austerity policy to reduce the national deficit, which was both praised for stabilizing the economy and criticized for exacerbating inequalities. \n\nOne of the most significant moments of his tenure was managing the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, where he successfully campaigned for Scotland to remain part of the UK. \n\nHowever, he may be best known internationally for organizing the 2016 referendum on the UK's membership in the European Union, a promise he had made to appease the eurosceptic faction of his party.  Against his own wishes, the referendum resulted in a vote for Brexit, and Cameron announced his resignation the day after the announcement of the results, believing he could not be the leader to lead the EU exit negotiations. \n\nAfter leaving 10 Downing Street, Cameron retired from politics and has since worked as a speaker and in business.

He was elected as a deputy for Corr\u00e8ze in 1988 and became the first secretary of the Socialist Party in 1997, a position he held until 2008.

He later participated in the creation of The Daisy (La Margherita) and the Democratic Party (PD). \n\nA key moment in his political career before the presidency was his opposition to the Gasparri media law in 2003, which was seen as a way to strengthen media control by the then Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi.  In protest, Mattarella resigned from his position as a deputy. \n\nBefore becoming president, Mattarella was elected as a judge to the Constitutional Court in 2011 by the Italian Parliament.  His election to the presidency was somewhat unexpected, but his profile as a moderate and his commitment to constitutional and republican values led to broad consensus around his candidacy. \n\nAs president, he played an active role in resolving political crises, responsible for appointing Prime Ministers and mediating in the formation of governments.  He was also a staunch defender of Europe and Italy's role in the European Union. \n\nSergio Mattarella is known for his reserve and attention to institutional principles, characteristics that have marked his approach to the presidency.

Rajoy implemented austerity measures aimed at reducing the public deficit, as well as structural reforms such as labor market reform, which drew criticism from trade unions and a segment of the population. \n\nFurthermore, Rajoy had to face the rise of the independence movement in Catalonia, a significant constitutional challenge for the central government.  The referendum on Catalonia's independence in 2017 and the subsequent secession attempt led to the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which suspended Catalonia's autonomy to restore constitutional order. \n\nThe end of his term was overshadowed by a series of corruption scandals involving the Popular Party and a tense political climate.  Rajoy was eventually ousted by a motion of censure led by the socialist Pedro S\u00e1nchez in June 2018.

At the age of 17, he joined the African National Congress (ANC), the main political party fighting for the rights of the black majority in South Africa.  In 1962, he became a member of the armed wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), where he received military training. \n\nIn 1963, Zuma was arrested with other ANC members and sentenced to ten years in prison for conspiracy against the apartheid government.  He spent these years imprisoned on Robben Island, the same prison where Nelson Mandela was held. \n\n**Political rise:**\nAfter his release in 1973, Zuma continued his work within the ANC, spending most of his time in exile outside of South Africa.  He rose through the ranks of the ANC during the 1980s and early 1990s. \n\nFollowing Nelson Mandela's release in 1990 and the dismantling of apartheid, Zuma returned to South Africa and became a major political figure in the transition to a democratic government.

He dissolved the government and the national assembly and banned political parties.  During his rule, he implemented a strict Islamist policy.

Internationally, he has been generally recognized as a stable partner by Western powers and has played an important regional role in Central Africa. \n\nNow over 85 years old, Paul Biya is one of the longest-serving African leaders in power.
