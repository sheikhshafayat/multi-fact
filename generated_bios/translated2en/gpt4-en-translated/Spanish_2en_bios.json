{"Xi Jinping": "Xi Jinping is a Chinese politician who has served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.  Considered one of the most powerful leaders in contemporary China, Xi has centralized institutional and personal power around himself, and his political thought has been incorporated into the party's and country's constitution, reflecting his influence on Chinese politics. \n\nXi Jinping was born on June 15, 1953 in Beijing, into a family that was part of the political elite.  His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a veteran revolutionary and political leader who held several important positions in the government.  However, during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), his family fell out of favor and Xi Zhongxun was purged, while Xi Jinping was sent to the countryside to perform forced labor as part of Mao Zedong's reeducation policies. \n\nXi Jinping joined the CPC in 1974 and studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, graduating in 1979.  He later obtained a doctorate in law and began his ascent in the party hierarchy by holding various positions in the provinces of Hebei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.  He earned a reputation for being an effective and unpretentious leader, with a strong ability to manage crises and promote economic development. \n\nIn 2007, he was promoted to the CPC Politburo and later to the Politburo Standing Committee in 2008, signaling him as one of the future leaders of the country.  Eventually, he succeeded Hu Jintao as the General Secretary of the CPC in November 2012, as President of the People's Republic of China in March 2013, and as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, thus consolidating control over the most important branches of Chinese power. \n\nSince taking office, Xi Jinping has promoted a national rejuvenation agenda and advocated for what he calls the \"Chinese dream\", which includes revitalizing the CPC, strengthening state control over the economy and society, and asserting China on the world stage.  He has launched anti-corruption campaigns that have punished high officials and military personnel, reinforced censorship and internet control, and persecuted dissidents and activists. \n\nInternationally, Xi has promoted the \"Belt and Road\" initiative to expand China's economic and political influence, sought to reform global financial institutions, and adopted a more assertive stance in foreign affairs, particularly in the South China Sea and in relations with Taiwan and the United States. \n\nOne of the most significant achievements of his regime was the abolishment of presidential term limits in 2018, which opened the door for him to remain in power indefinitely.  Xi's government has also been criticized for human rights violations, including repression in Hong Kong and policies in the Xinjiang region, which have strained relations with the international community. \n\nUnder his leadership, China has experienced continuous economic growth, although it faces challenges such as an aging population, regional inequality, debt, and trade tensions with other economic powers.  Xi Jinping remains a central figure in China's evolution, and his policies and decisions will continue to influence the country's development and global power dynamics in the years to come. ", "Narendra Modi": "Narendra Modi is an Indian politician and the current Prime Minister of India, having assumed office since May 26, 2014.  He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) political alliance, and has been a prominent figure in Indian politics for several decades. \n\nHe was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, a small town in the state of Gujarat, to a family belonging to the Ghanchi caste.  From a young age, Modi showed interest in social work and became involved with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization.  His commitment to the RSS eventually led him to join the BJP in 1987. \n\nModi quickly rose through the ranks of the party due to his charisma and organizational skills.  He served as the BJP's general secretary in Gujarat and later in Haryana.  He stood out as a key figure in strengthening the party in Gujarat. \n\nIn 2001, after the resignation of the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Keshubhai Patel, Modi was elected to replace him.  He took effective measures to promote industrialization and economic development in the state, and his leadership helped improve infrastructure and attract foreign and domestic investments.  However, his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat was also marked by controversy, particularly in relation to the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002, which resulted in the death of numerous people, mainly from the Muslim community. \n\nModi denied any responsibility and claimed that he did everything possible to control the situation.  However, his administration was criticized both nationally and internationally for its handling of the riots.  Despite the controversy, Modi was re-elected in 2002, 2007, and 2012 as Chief Minister of Gujarat, holding his position until 2014. \n\nDuring his years in the Gujarat government, he continued to implement policies to promote economic growth and modernization of the state.  His leadership and improvements in Gujarat's economy helped him forge an image as a figure of development and governance. \n\nIn 2013, Narendra Modi was selected as the BJP's candidate for Prime Minister for the 2014 general elections in India.  Under his leadership, the BJP won a landslide victory, obtaining an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.  Since taking office, Modi has initiated numerous economic reforms, including the implementation of a national goods and services tax (GST), the \"Make in India\" campaign to turn India into a global manufacturing hub, and the \"Swachh Bharat\" initiative to promote cleanliness and hygiene throughout the country. \n\nModi has been praised for his focus on digital reforms, such as the \"Digital India\" initiative, and for his focus on expanding infrastructure and renewable energy.  In addition, his foreign policy has been proactive, seeking to strengthen ties with countries both regionally and globally. \n\nIn 2019, Modi led the BJP to another electoral victory, consolidating his position as one of the most powerful leaders of contemporary India.  However, he remains a divisive figure, acclaimed by his supporters for his economic policies and criticized by his detractors in terms of handling freedom of expression, minority rights, and other social issues.

He is an Indonesian politician who has been the President of Indonesia since 2014.  Before becoming president, Jokowi served as mayor of Surakarta and governor of Jakarta, building a reputation as a practical and results-oriented leader, close to the concerns of the common people. \n\nBiography:\n\n**Childhood and Education:**\nJokowi grew up in a humble family; his parents were wood sellers.  Despite economic difficulties, he managed to obtain a decent education, which allowed him to attend Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in forestry engineering in 1985. \n\n**Business Career:**\nBefore entering politics, Jokowi started his career in the private sector.  He worked in the wood industry and eventually became a successful entrepreneur in the furniture business.  His experience in commerce gave him a valuable understanding of the business world and a pragmatic approach to solving economic and management problems. \n\n**Political Career:**\nJokowi entered politics in 2005 when he was elected mayor of Surakarta, his hometown.  As mayor, he was recognized for his efforts to boost local economic development, improve infrastructure and public administration, and for his direct approach in dialogue with citizens.  His successful policies and leadership style gained national attention. \n\nIn 2012, Jokowi made a significant leap in his political career by being elected governor of Jakarta.  In this role, he continued with his participatory management style and quickly gained public sympathy for his focus on improving public services, combating corruption, and reducing floods in the city. \n\n**Presidency:**\nJokowi's growing popularity led him to become the presidential candidate in 2014.  He won the presidential elections against Prabowo Subianto and was inaugurated as the 7th President of the Republic of Indonesia on October 20, 2014.  His election was seen as a milestone for Indonesian democracy, as he was the first president not to have a military background or belong to the Indonesian political or economic elite. \n\nDuring his first term, Jokowi focused on infrastructure development, bureaucracy reform, investment in the country's maritime sector, and improving health and education services.  His government has also been known for its focus on political and economic stability, and for adopting policies that promote foreign investment. \n\nIn 2019, Jokowi was reelected for a second term after defeating Prabowo Subianto again.  He has continued to promote his development and reform agenda, although he has also faced criticism for human rights issues and his methods to strengthen national development sometimes at the expense of the environment. \n\n**Personal Life:**\nJokowi is married to Iriana Joko Widodo, and they have three children together.  He is known for his humility and his 'man of the people' approach.  Apart from politics, Jokowi has a well-known hobby for heavy metal music, being a fan of bands like Metallica and Megadeth. \n\nJokowi's presidency has coincided with a period of significant transformation in Indonesia, a country with complex ethnic and religious diversity, and the largest economy in Southeast Asia.  His legacy will be defined by his ability to maintain national unity, promote economic growth, and improve the quality of life for the Indonesian population in a context of changing global and regional challenges. ", "Mamnoon Hussain": "Mamnoon Hussain was a Pakistani politician who served as the 12th President of Pakistan, holding office from September 2013 to September 2018. \n\nBorn on December 23, 1940, in the Indian city of Agra, Mamnoon Hussain migrated with his family to Pakistan in 1949 after the partition of the Indian subcontinent.  They settled in Karachi, where Hussain was educated and later entered the business world. \n\nHussain obtained his degree in commerce from the University of Karachi in 1963 and then ventured into the textile industry, where he developed his professional career.  His entry into political life was as a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), a major political party in Pakistan. \n\nProving to be a loyal member of the PML-N, he held various positions within the party and also served in public administration roles.  He was appointed as the Governor of Sindh in 1999, but his tenure was brief due to the military coup that ousted Nawaz Sharif's government that same year. \n\nOver the years, Hussain remained active in politics and within his party, although he maintained a relatively low profile in national politics.  His election as President of Pakistan in 2013 was somewhat surprising, as he was not one of the country's most prominent politicians.  His candidacy for president was supported by the PML-N, which had won the general elections that year, and given Pakistan's parliamentary system where the president is elected by an electoral college consisting of members of Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, his election was secure due to the PML-N's majority. \n\nAs president, Mamnoon Hussain had a mainly ceremonial role, as the Pakistani Constitution grants most executive power to the Prime Minister.  During his presidency, Hussain tried to promote national unity and economic development, although his influence on everyday politics and governance was limited. \n\nAfter completing his presidential term, Hussain left office in September 2018 and was succeeded by Arif Alvi.  His time as president was characterized by relative political stability and a discreet style in carrying out his functions. \n\nMamnoon Hussain passed away on July 14, 2021, after a battle with cancer.  He was remembered by his colleagues and compatriots as a modest man dedicated to the service of his country.

She is the eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first President of Bangladesh known as the \"Father of the Nation\" for leading the country to independence in 1971. \n\nEducation and early years:\nSheikh Hasina attended the University of Dhaka, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Bengali language and literature.  During her youth, she witnessed the political turmoil that led to the independence war of Bangladesh from Pakistan. \n\nEarly political career:\nHer formal entry into politics was tragic: in 1975, her father and most of her family were assassinated in a military coup.  Hasina and her sister Rehana survived, as they were abroad at the time.  This event deeply marked Hasina and defined much of her future political life.  She stayed in exile in India, where she continued to be a prominent figure in Bangladeshi politics in exile until her return to Bangladesh in 1981. \n\nLeadership of the Awami League Party:\nUpon her return, she assumed leadership of the Awami League Party, which was founded by her father.

She was a staunch critic of military administrations and, due to her political activities, was arrested on several occasions. \n\nPrime Minister of Bangladesh:\nSheikh Hasina was first elected as Prime Minister of Bangladesh in 1996, a position she held until 2001.  During her tenure, she focused on education, health, and women's empowerment programs.  She also played a significant role in the signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Treaty, which ended decades of conflict. \n\nAfter a period in opposition, due to an interim administration and the rival party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina returned to power in 2009 and has been re-elected since then in 2014 and 2018, although these last elections have been criticized for alleged irregularities and lack of transparency. \n\nAchievements and controversies:\nAs Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina has been praised for her leadership in economic growth and development in Bangladesh, including significant improvements in the country's infrastructure, poverty reduction, and achievements in gender parity in education.  However, her administration has faced criticism for alleged authoritarian practices, restrictions on press freedom, and human rights violations. \n\nInternationally, Sheikh Hasina has been recognized for her role in the Rohingya refugee crisis, in which Bangladesh has welcomed hundreds of thousands of displaced people from Myanmar.  On the other hand, she has been questioned on how her government has handled the human rights situation related to this crisis. \n\nDespite the challenges, Sheikh Hasina remains one of the most influential and important political figures in the contemporary history of Bangladesh, and her legacy is seen both in the substantial progress of her country and in the deep criticisms of her style of governance.

During his first term, which was relatively brief, he attempted to reform education and strengthen Japan's alliance with the United States, while also seeking a firmer stance on international affairs, including North Korea's nuclear program.  However, due to political scandals and health issues, Abe resigned in 2007. \n\nAfter a period out of the spotlight of politics, Abe made a strong comeback and was reelected as LDP president in 2012, which led him back to the position of prime minister in December of that year.  During his second term, he introduced \"Abenomics,\" a mix of aggressive fiscal stimulus measures, monetary easing, and structural reforms aimed at revitalizing the Japanese economy struggling with deflation. \n\nIn foreign policy, Abe sought to increase Japan's presence and influence on the world stage, advocating for a tougher line against North Korea and seeking a stronger relationship with Western allies, especially the United States.  He also pushed for a reinterpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution to allow for a greater role for the country's self-defense forces in global security operations. \n\nAbe left office on September 16, 2020, citing health problems, and was succeeded by Yoshihide Suga.  His time in office made him the prime minister with the longest non-consecutive service in Japan's history. \n\nShinzo Abe died on July 8, 2022, after being attacked by a gunman while giving a speech in Nara, Japan.

However, in 1998, he was dismissed and imprisoned for four months for inciting religious hatred after reciting a poem that was interpreted as an incitement against Turkish secularism. \n\nUpon his release, Erdo\u011fan adopted a more moderate and pragmatic approach.  He co-founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, notably distancing himself from his Islamist past and promoting a platform of \"conservative democracy. \" The AKP won the parliamentary elections the following year, and Erdo\u011fan became Prime Minister of Turkey in 2003, after a law prohibiting him from holding public office was changed. \n\nAs Prime Minister, Erdo\u011fan oversaw a period of significant economic growth and reforms aimed at strengthening Turkey's democratic institutions and economy.

Raised in a context of political turmoil, Park's early life was marked by these tragic events, which led her to assume the role of First Lady after her mother's death. \n\nAfter her father's death, Park briefly distanced herself from politics.  She studied electronic engineering at Sogang University and also obtained a Master's degree in women's studies at the University of Grenoble in France. \n\nHer political career began in earnest in 1998 when she was elected as a member of the National Assembly of South Korea for the Grand National Party, later known as Saenuri Party.  She was known for her strong stance on security issues and conservative economic approach.  Park was a popular legislator and held leadership positions within the party. \n\nHer first presidential candidacy was in 2007, although she was defeated in her party's primaries.  However, she persevered and was elected as the 18th President of South Korea in December 2012.  Her presidency focused on various initiatives, including economic reform and improving relations with North Korea. \n\nHowever, her tenure faced significant challenges and controversies.  The Sewol ferry tragedy in 2014, in which more than 300 people died, mostly high school students, raised questions about her leadership and her government's response capabilities. \n\nThe scandal that led to her impeachment began in late 2016, when it was revealed that Choi Soon-sil, a confidante of Park, had exerted undue influence in government affairs and had used her relationship with the president to enrich herself.  This triggered massive public protests and led to a political impeachment process that culminated in her removal from office in March 2017. \n\nIn 2018, Park Geun-hye was convicted of abuse of power, coercion, and bribery.  She was initially sentenced to a total of 24 years in prison, which was reduced to 22 years after appeals.  Her downfall from power has been one of the most dramatic episodes in recent South Korean politics and an example of how the links between political power and corporate interests can lead to corruption and abuse of power. \n\nIt is important to note that details about her conviction and the length of her sentence may have changed subsequently, depending on the results of additional appeals or changes in South Korea's political situation.

He graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Baghdad in 1959 and later obtained a Ph. D.  in Islamic Law from Al-Azhar University in Egypt.  Upon his return to Iraq, Masum became a professor of Islamic law at the University of Basra in the early 1970s. \n\nPolitical career:\nMasum's political career began in the 1960s when he joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party (PDK).  He faced political repression, exile, and life as a militant at various stages of his career, particularly under Saddam Hussein's regime. \n\nAfter Hussein's overthrow in 2003, he became a founding member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and played a key role in drafting the new Iraqi constitution.  He was elected to the National Assembly in 2004 and served as the first President of the Iraqi National Assembly in the post-Saddam era. \n\nPresidency:\nOn July 24, 2014, the Iraqi Parliament elected Masum as President, a largely ceremonial role in current Iraqi politics, which follows a parliamentary system.  His election reflected the political practice of power-sharing among the country's main ethnicities and sects, assigning the presidency to a Kurd, the prime minister position to a Shia, and the parliament speaker position to a Sunni. \n\nDuring his tenure, Masum worked amidst significant challenges for Iraq, including the emergence of the Islamic State (ISIS) that seized control of large areas of the country in 2014.  He sought to promote national unity and dialogue among Iraq's different communities and political factions.  He was also responsible for ratifying laws and representing Iraq in international relations. \n\nMasum left office in October 2018 and was succeeded by Barham Salih.  His presidency is remembered for facing one of the most tumultuous periods in modern Iraqi history, marked by sectarian conflicts and the fight against extremist groups.

He obtained his bachelor's degree in Anthropology from the American University in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1973.  He then moved to the United States to pursue a master's and a doctorate in Anthropology at Columbia University, which he completed in 1983. \n\nAfter earning his doctorate, Ghani joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University as a professor of Anthropology and International Studies.  During this time, he also worked as an anthropologist for the World Bank, focusing on projects to improve economies in developing countries. \n\nReturn to Afghanistan:\nFollowing the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, Ashraf Ghani returned to Afghanistan to contribute to the country's reconstruction process.  He played a significant role in the Loya Jirga, a grand traditional assembly used to establish a new government after the overthrow of the Taliban regime.  He later served as a UN advisor and as Minister of Finance in the Afghan interim government between 2002 and 2004.  In this role, he was instrumental in implementing economic reforms and promoting fiscal transparency and governance. \n\nPolitical Career:\nGhani ran for the presidency of Afghanistan for the first time in 2009, although he was unsuccessful.  He ran again in the 2014 elections and, after a prolonged and controversial electoral process that required an audit under international supervision, Ghani was declared the winner and succeeded Hamid Karzai as President. \n\nDuring his presidency, Ghani faced significant challenges, including the persistent threat of the Taliban, entrenched corruption, and the country's dependence on foreign aid.  He sought to implement reforms to modernize the economy, improve infrastructure, and strengthen Afghan security forces, while also pursuing peace with the Taliban through various rounds of negotiations. \n\nFall of the Government:\nIn 2019, Ashraf Ghani was reelected in elections marked once again by fraud and controversy.  His second term was even more challenging.  The withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan, announced by the Trump administration and continued by the Biden administration, left Ghani's government in a precarious position.  In August 2021, the Taliban swiftly took control of much of the country, culminating in the fall of Kabul. \n\nGhani fled Afghanistan when the Taliban entered the capital, leading to criticism and accusations of abandoning the country at its most critical moment.  He later sought refuge in the United Arab Emirates.  The rapid fall of Kabul and Ghani's escape marked the collapse of the Afghan Islamic Republic government and the return to power of the Taliban after nearly two decades. \n\nFollowing his presidency, Ghani has faced criticism and scrutiny, both for his role in the fall of the Afghan government and for his management during his tenure.  His exact whereabouts and role after his presidency are not publicly known.

He began his political career as the governor of the Riyadh province in 1954, when he was only 19 years old, and held that position for almost five decades until 2011.  His tenure as governor was characterized by a significant expansion and modernization of the capital, including infrastructure, education, and health services. \n\nIn March 2013, he was appointed Minister of Defense, under which he oversaw the modernization and operations of the Saudi armed forces.  Additionally, Salman has been the head of the Economic and Development Council since 2014, where he played a key role in implementing broad economic reforms aimed at diversifying the Saudi economy beyond oil, known as Vision 2030. \n\nAs king, Salman has continued to strengthen Saudi Arabia's strategic relations with other nations, including the United States and Middle Eastern countries.  He has also led the military coalition against Houthi rebels in Yemen, seeking to restore the internationally recognized Yemeni government.  However, this conflict has raised international concern due to the humanitarian consequences in Yemen. \n\nInternally, Salman's reign has seen a blend of conservatism and modernization.  He has enacted some social reforms, such as the historic decision in 2017 to allow women to drive.  His son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, often credited with driving these reforms, is seen as the face of change in the kingdom, although he has also been criticized for his handling of human rights issues, including the repression of dissenters and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \n\nDespite international and local challenges, Salman has sought to present an image of leadership and stability.  As he ages, succession planning has become an increasingly relevant issue.  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, due to his influence and official roles, is considered next in line for the throne, preparing to guide Saudi Arabia into the future.

Born on January 30, 1938 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, which was then part of the Soviet Union, Karimov was raised in an orphanage before being adopted. \n\nKarimov studied engineering and economics, starting his career in the aviation and machinery industry.  He progressively rose within the apparatus of the Communist Party of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, taking on several administrative and governmental positions.  In 1989, he was appointed First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, effectively becoming the leader of the republic. \n\nAs the Soviet Union began to dismantle in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Karimov led the movement towards Uzbekistan's independence.  He became the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan on March 24, 1990, even before the country formally declared its independence from the Soviet Union on August 31, 1991. \n\nHis government was marked by strong repression against political opposition and a limited free press, often criticized by international human rights organizations.  Karimov maintained a tight control over the country, promoting economic policies that, while aimed at post-Soviet stability, did not prevent issues such as corruption and a highly regulated economy dominated by the state. \n\nUnder his leadership, Uzbekistan pursued a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, playing a strategic role in the region, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when Uzbek air bases were used by US forces for operations in Afghanistan.  However, relations with the West were complicated, especially after the Andijan massacre in 2005, where Uzbek security forces violently repressed a protest, resulting in numerous deaths. \n\nIslam Karimov was reelected several times in elections whose integrity was questioned by international observers.  His government was known for its authoritarian approach and lack of transparency, and he personally was accused of human rights violations and suppression of dissent. \n\nKarimov died on September 2, 2016, after suffering a stroke.  He left a nation with a legacy of authoritarian stability and a set of socioeconomic and political challenges for his successor.  The news of his death generated political uncertainty in the region, given the lack of a clear successor in a country that had been shaped by his leadership for over 25 years.

Born on July 23, 1953, he is the son of Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, and Rahah Noah.  Raised in a prominent political family, Najib was educated in Malaysia and the United Kingdom, where he studied at Malvern College and later graduated in economics from the University of Nottingham. \n\nNajib entered politics in 1976, at the age of 23, following the sudden death of his father, succeeding him as the youngest parliamentarian at that time.  He was quickly promoted within the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) political party, which had dominated Malaysian politics since the country's independence in 1957. \n\nBefore becoming Prime Minister, Najib held various ministerial positions in the governments of his predecessors, including the ministries of Energy, Telecommunications, and Education, as well as Minister of Defence and Minister of Finance.  His political career is notable for its continuous ascent and for having held a series of important ministerial portfolios. \n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, he implemented some reforms to boost the economy and modernize the country with initiatives such as 1Malaysia and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP).  However, his tenure was also plagued by controversies, including the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption scandal, which involved the alleged misappropriation of billions of dollars from a state development fund under his supervision. \n\nThe 1MDB scandal had significant repercussions both within and outside of Malaysia, leading to investigations in several countries.  Questions about the integrity and transparency of Najib's government significantly contributed to the defeats of the UMNO party and the Barisan Nasional coalition in the 2018 general elections, led by the return to politics of former Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamad. \n\nAfter losing power, Najib has faced multiple charges of corruption and money laundering related to the 1MDB scandal.  He has maintained his innocence and claimed that he was misled by financial advisors. \n\nNajib Razak's trial has been a historic event in Malaysia, as it marks the first time a former Prime Minister has been brought to justice for criminal charges.  In July 2020, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison and a fine of 210 million Malaysian ringgit (approximately 49 million US dollars) for his involvement in the 1MDB case.  Najib appealed the conviction and while his appeals were ongoing, he remained an active political figure and a Member of Parliament for Pekan, although his reputation and future in Malaysian politics have been significantly affected. ", "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi": "Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi is a Yemeni politician who has served as President of Yemen since February 27, 2012.  Hadi assumed the presidency as part of an internationally backed political transition process that followed the country's protests during the Arab Spring and the subsequent resignation of then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh. \n\nAbdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was born on September 1, 1945, in Thukain, a village in the Abyan governorate in southern Yemen.  He joined the army in 1970 and received military training both inside and outside of Yemen, including in Great Britain and Egypt.  Over the years, he rose in rank within the Yemeni armed forces. \n\nWhen South Yemen and North Yemen unified in 1990, Hadi played a key role in unifying the armies of the two previously divided nations.  He served as Yemen's Minister of Defense from 1994 to 1998 and as Vice President under the presidency of Ali Abdullah Saleh from 1994. \n\nDuring Saleh's tenure, Hadi maintained a relatively low profile.  However, his role became critical in 2011 when protests against Saleh rocked the country, part of a series of uprisings in the region known as the Arab Spring.  Following an attack on the presidential palace in June 2011, Saleh was injured and traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment.  During his absence, Hadi temporarily assumed presidential responsibilities. \n\nThe political situation led to the signing of a power transfer agreement in November 2011, in which Saleh agreed to transfer power to Hadi in exchange for immunity for himself and his family.  Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was formally elected president in an election held in February 2012, where he was the only candidate, as part of the transition process designed to bring stability to the country.  His mandate was intended to be temporary, but several extensions and the growing instability in Yemen have kept Hadi in power. \n\nHadi's government has faced enormous challenges.  The situation in Yemen was further complicated by escalating tensions between factions and the insurgency of the Houthis (a Shiite rebel movement) who took control of the capital, Sana'a, in 2014.  In 2015, Hadi was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia after Houthi rebels effectively took control of a large part of Yemen, including the capital. \n\nSince then, Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war with Hadi leading the internationally recognized government, based in Aden and later temporarily in exile in Saudi Arabia, but with much of the north and west of the country controlled by the Houthis.  The situation in Yemen has been further complicated by the intervention of a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which seeks to restore Hadi's government. \n\nHadi's presidency has been marked by continuous efforts to regain control of Yemeni territories, and by criticisms of the management of the humanitarian crisis that the conflict has caused.  The war has had a devastating toll on the civilian population, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world with millions of Yemenis depending on humanitarian aid to survive. \n\nThis biography is based on information available until early 2023 and may not reflect more recent developments in the political situation in Yemen or the life of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.

He joined the Nepali Congress in 1954 and remained loyal to the party throughout his life.  His political career gained significant momentum in the 1990s, after the reintroduction of multi-party democracy in Nepal. \n\nDuring the phase of struggle for democracy in Nepal, Koirala was a vocal critic of the monarchy and an advocate for a democratic government.  He spent several years in prison and in exile due to his involvement in political movements against the monarchy. \n\nIn 1991, Sushil Koirala was elected as a member of the House of Representatives (Pratinidhi Sabha) of Nepal, although his involvement in high-level politics would not take off until years later.  He was known for his simple life and his principled political beliefs. \n\nWithin the Nepali Congress, he held various positions, including member of the Working Committee and the Central Working Committee.  Additionally, Sushil Koirala served as the Vice President of the party before being elected President of the Nepali Congress in 2010. \n\nHis most prominent moment in politics came in February 2014, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Nepal.  His administration faced significant challenges, including the immensely difficult task of leading the country towards a new Constitution after years of deadlock and disagreements among the major political parties.  Ultimately, during his tenure, Nepal passed a new Constitution in September 2015, although it was met with controversies and protests from some ethnic minorities in the country. \n\nSushil Koirala was known for his commitment to the principle of parliamentary democracy and his dedication to establishing a democratic republic in Nepal.  However, his tenure as Prime Minister was also marked by criticism related to the slow pace of reconstruction following the devastating 2015 earthquake that hit Nepal. \n\nSushil Koirala lost the position of Prime Minister in October 2015 and died on February 9, 2016, at the age of 76, due to respiratory problems.  His death was a blow to Nepali politics, especially to his party, the Nepali Congress, where his leadership had provided a stabilizing influence.

He studied Law at Leningrad State University, where he also joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and graduated in 1975. \n\nAfter graduating, Putin joined the KGB, the Soviet security and intelligence agency, where he worked for 16 years.  His career in the KGB included an assignment in Dresden, East Germany, from 1985 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  After his service in the KGB, Putin retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel and returned to Leningrad. \n\nIn 1990, he became an advisor to Anatoly Sobchak, rector of Leningrad University and soon the city's first democratically elected mayor.  Putin was promoted to the position of deputy mayor and was known for his tough stance against corruption. \n\nWhen Sobchak lost reelection in 1996, Putin moved to Moscow, where his political career advanced rapidly under the presidency of Boris Yeltsin.  He held various leadership positions before being appointed director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the KGB, in 1998, and later secretary of the Russian Security Council. \n\nIn August 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly announced that Putin would be his successor and appointed him prime minister.  A few months later, Yeltsin resigned, and Putin became the interim president of Russia on December 31, 1999.  He quickly won the presidential elections in March 2000. \n\nDuring his first term, Putin implemented economic and political reforms, and it was also during this time that he launched a second war against the separatist region of Chechnya.  His handling of the Chechen crisis contributed to his popularity in Russia.  He was reelected in 2004 with a large majority. \n\nIn 2008, due to Russia's constitutional restrictions preventing more than two consecutive presidential terms, Putin could not run for a third term.  Therefore, he assumed the position of prime minister while his protege, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.  During this time, Putin remained the dominant figure in Russian politics. \n\nIn 2012, Putin returned to the Kremlin for a third term as president after constitutional reforms extended the presidential term from four to six years.  He was reelected for a fourth term in 2018. \n\nUnder Putin's presidency, Russia has experienced a resurgence in global political influence, along with internal consolidation of power.  However, his government has been repeatedly criticized both inside and outside Russia for the erosion of democratic rights and press freedom, the persecution of political opponents, and support for separatists in regional conflicts such as in Ukraine. \n\nPutin has been a central figure in major global events, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which led to international sanctions against Russia, and the military intervention in Syria in support of Bashar al-Assad.  His tenure has been characterized by rhetoric and policies that often challenge the post-Cold War Western order. \n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked another critical point in his leadership, escalating international tensions and prompting condemnation and additional sanctions from the international community.  Putin has remained firm in the face of external pressure, maintaining a tight grip on power in Russia and exerting significant influence on global affairs.

He was academically trained in theology and became a Lutheran pastor, a profession that allowed him some independence from the atheist State of East Germany.  Through his work as a pastor, Gauck gained experience in supporting civil rights groups and dissent. \n\nAs political tensions in the GDR began to escalate in the late 1980s, Gauck became more involved in politics.  He participated in the growing opposition to the communist regime and was one of the leaders of the church movement that played a significant role in the peaceful protests that ultimately led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  After German reunification in 1990, Gauck was elected to the first (and last) freely elected parliament of the GDR. \n\nWith the reunification, Gauck became the Special Commissioner for the Stasi Archives, the feared secret police of the GDR.  In this role, he was responsible for overseeing the review and management of the millions of files that the Stasi had compiled on citizens over decades.  His work in defending transparency and fighting injustice earned him recognition and respect both in Germany and internationally. \n\nJoachim Gauck was not formally affiliated with any political party, which contributed to his public image as a non-political and conciliatory figure.  In 2012, after broad consensus among the major political parties, he was elected as the President of Germany.  During his term, which lasted until March 2017, Gauck stood out for his strong moral principles and advocated for freedom, democracy, and accountability for Germany's past, including both Nazism and the GDR dictatorship. \n\nAdditionally, he became a respected public speaker and advocate for European integration, dialogue between cultures, and mutual understanding.

Coming from a privileged background, Cameron attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and then the prestigious Eton College.  He later studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, University of Oxford, graduating with first-class honors in 1988. \n\nAfter graduating, Cameron worked for the Conservative Party, initially as a researcher and later as an adviser to various ministers.  His career in politics included a period as Director of Corporate Communications for Carlton Communications before being elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Witney constituency in Oxfordshire in 2001. \n\nHis rise in politics was relatively swift; he was promoted within the party hierarchy and held various shadow positions, including leadership on education and employment matters.  In 2005, Cameron was elected leader of the Conservative Party, succeeding Michael Howard.  As leader, Cameron sought to modernize the party, promoting a more inclusive and centrist image, often compared to Tony Blair's \"Third Way,\" and emphasizing policies related to climate change and corporate social responsibility. \n\nDuring his leadership, the Conservatives did not secure an absolute majority in the 2010 general elections, but Cameron became Prime Minister leading a coalition with the Liberal Democrats under Nick Clegg.  His time in office was marked by the implementation of austerity policies aimed at addressing the UK's budget deficit, as well as reforms to the welfare and education systems. \n\nReelected in 2015 with an absolute parliamentary majority, Cameron continued his reform agenda but faced a significant challenge with the growing Euroscepticism within his party and the country.  In an attempt to resolve the division over the UK's membership in the European Union, Cameron called for a referendum on the country's EU membership, a promise he had made during the election campaign. \n\nThe referendum, held on June 23, 2016, resulted in a victory for the \"Brexit\" campaign.  Although Cameron had advocated for remaining in the EU, he accepted the result and announced his resignation as Prime Minister.  He was succeeded by Theresa May, who assumed office with the task of leading the negotiations for the UK's exit from the EU. \n\nCameron has also been criticized for his role in calling the referendum, which many saw as a failed attempt to appease the Eurosceptic faction of his party and resulted in significant political and economic change for the UK.  Since leaving office, he has been relatively removed from frontline politics and has worked on various projects, including setting up a charitable foundation and publishing his memoirs in 2019.

He also supported legislation to legalize marriage and adoption for same-sex couples, a measure that became law in 2013. \n\nHollande's presidency was also marked by challenges in foreign policy and security, including France's military intervention in Mali in 2013 to combat Islamic insurgent groups, and a series of terrorist attacks on French soil, the deadliest of which occurred on November 13, 2015 in Paris when several attackers killed 130 people and injured hundreds more. \n\nDespite his efforts, Hollande struggled with low approval ratings throughout much of his term due to the stagnant economy and persistent unemployment.  He decided not to run for reelection in 2017, becoming the first sitting French president not to seek a second term since the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958. \n\nAfter leaving office, Hollande has remained active in public life and in the Socialist Party, and has written several books addressing his time in office as well as his vision of the political situation in France and Europe.

He entered politics at a young age by joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1959, when he was only 17 years old.  Zuma became an active member of the ANC's armed wing, known as Umkhonto we Sizwe, in 1962, after the apartheid government banned the movement. \n\nIn 1963, Zuma was arrested along with a group of 45 ANC recruits and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he served at the famous Robben Island prison, where Nelson Mandela was also imprisoned.

In 2001, then-President Daniel arap Moi appointed him Minister of Local Government and later, in 2002, as his preferred successor.  Although KANU, with Kenyatta as its candidate, was defeated in the 2002 general elections by Mwai Kibaki and the opposition coalition NARC, Uhuru established himself as a central figure in Kenyan politics. \n\nKenyatta continued to lead KANU and in 2007 was re-elected to Parliament and appointed Deputy Minister in the portfolios of local government and later in finance.  However, his political career became complicated in 2010 when the International Criminal Court (ICC) accused him of crimes against humanity in connection with the post-election violence following the disputed 2007 Kenyan presidential elections.  Despite these accusations, Kenyatta was elected president in 2013 and the ICC charges were withdrawn in December 2014 due to lack of evidence and alleged witness interference. \n\nDuring his presidency, Kenyatta focused on a development agenda known as the \"Big Four Agenda,\" which included manufacturing, food security, affordable housing, and universal health coverage.

His youth and education coincided with a period of great political turmoil in Uganda's history. \n\nMuseveni studied at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in political science and economics.  At the university, he became involved in revolutionary politics and anti-colonial struggles in the region.  He was influenced by African liberation movements and socialist ideologies. \n\nIn the early 1970s, Museveni took an active role in the fight against Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, being part of the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF).  Following Amin's fall in 1979, Museveni held various positions in subsequent governments but became the leader of the resistance when he felt that the governments that followed did not uphold the principles of democracy and justice. \n\nIn 1981, after a period of political instability and a coup that brought Milton Obote to power, Museveni and his followers started a guerrilla war against the regime.  He founded the National Resistance Army (NRA), the military wing of the National Resistance Movement (NRM). \n\nAfter five years of conflict, Museveni and his forces took control of the capital Kampala, and he assumed power in 1986.  He promised stability and led efforts to rehabilitate Uganda's infrastructure, economy, and civic institutions.  He introduced a political system that restricted the activity of political parties, known as \"no-party democracy,\" although critics viewed it as a method to maintain power without opposition. \n\nIn 1996, Museveni was elected president in what were considered the first direct elections in Uganda's history.  He has been reelected multiple times since then, in 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021, although these electoral processes have often been plagued by accusations of voter intimidation, fraud, and violence.  Constitutional reforms that allowed for the removal of term limits and the presidential age limit have been seen as maneuvers to perpetuate his rule. \n\nWhile Museveni has been praised for stabilizing the country, introducing capitalist economic reforms, and successfully combating HIV/AIDS, he has also been criticized for weakening democratic institutions, persecuting political opponents, restricting press freedoms, and involving Uganda in regional conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. \n\nAs of my last update in 2023, Museveni remains a central and controversial figure in African politics, and his presidency is one of the most enduring regimes on the continent.

Shortly thereafter, he assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, a role he held for much of Houari Boumediene's presidency. \n\nThroughout his career as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bouteflika played a prominent role in international affairs, becoming a key figure in the non-aligned movement and various foreign policy negotiations.  His handling of Algerian diplomacy earned him respect in international circles, although he was also known for his lavish lifestyle and autocratic tendencies. \n\nAfter Boumediene's death in 1978 and subsequent fall from grace during the tenure of his successor, Chadli Bendjedid, Bouteflika spent several years abroad.  It was not until the 1990s that he returned to the political scene when Algeria was engulfed in a violent civil war between the government and armed Islamist groups.  In 1999, Bouteflika was elected president with the support of the military and under the promise of restoring peace and stability. \n\nDuring his presidency, Bouteflika successfully implemented a policy of national reconciliation that led to a significant decrease in violence.  His government also saw Algeria's return to the international stage and several economic reforms that contributed to the country's recovery after years of conflict.  Algeria experienced an economic boom during the 2000s, largely due to high oil and natural gas prices. \n\nHowever, his time in power was also the subject of criticism and controversy.

He had a successful military career, and in 1989, as a brigadier in the Sudanese army, he led a group of officers in a coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi.  Once in power, al-Bashir dissolved the government and political parties, establishing an authoritarian regime promising to end corruption and bring peace to the war-torn country, divided between the north and south. \n\nDuring his rule, al-Bashir prioritized the enforcement of a strict version of Sharia law, exacerbating tensions between different religious and ethnic groups.  The Darfur conflict, which erupted in 2003, was particularly significant.  Al-Bashir's government was accused of responding to the insurrection in Darfur by supporting Arab militias known as the Janjaweed in a campaign against non-Arab ethnic groups, resulting in a severe humanitarian crisis with hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. \n\nIn 2009, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur.  In 2010, charges of genocide were added.  Despite the arrest warrants, he continued to travel to countries that refused to detain him, causing international controversy and highlighting the challenges faced by the ICC in enforcing its mandates. \n\nThe situation in Sudan began to change in late 2018, when massive protests erupted in response to the deteriorating economy and persistent government corruption.  These protests eventually turned into open demands for al-Bashir to resign.  On April 11, 2019, he was ousted by a military coup after months of popular protests.  He was subsequently arrested and imprisoned by the new military authorities of the country, who promised a transition to a civilian government. \n\nIn December 2019, al-Bashir was convicted by a Sudanese court of corruption and other financial crimes.  Additionally, he still faces possible charges related to the violence in Darfur and his role in the 1989 coup.  Al-Bashir's legal situation in Sudan and in relation to the ICC remains complicated and constantly evolving, reflecting the challenges of both Sudan's justice system and international justice.

He became involved in politics from a young age.  He studied at a public university in Marrakech, earning a degree in Physics in the 1970s. \n\nDuring his university years, he was an activist and joined various student movements.  In those years, Benkirane developed his political identity, aligning himself with Islamic ideologies and participating in the founding of the Popular Democratic and Constitutional Movement in 1967, which would be the basis for the future formation of the PJD. \n\nIn the 1990s, Benkirane began to stand out in the political sphere as the leader of the PJD and its predecessor, the Popular Democratic and Constitutional Movement.  In 1997, he was elected as a deputy in the Moroccan parliament for the first time and quickly became an important voice within his party. \n\nThe PJD strengthened during the first decade of the new millennium, and Benkirane became the Secretary General of the party in 2008.  Under his leadership, the PJD scored a significant victory in the 2011 parliamentary elections, leading to his appointment as Prime Minister by King Mohammed VI. \n\nDuring his tenure as head of government, Benkirane tried to implement reforms in response to the population's demands for political and economic changes in the country.  He worked on reforming state subsidies and the compensation fund, as well as pension fund reform.  However, his term was also marked by challenges, including tensions within the ruling coalition and criticisms for the slow pace of promised reforms. \n\nIn 2016, although the PJD won the elections again, Benkirane was unable to form a new government due to opposition from various political parties, leading to a political deadlock.  In March 2017, the King of Morocco dismissed him from his position and appointed Saadeddine Othmani, also a member of the PJD, to form a new government. \n\nDespite stepping down as Prime Minister, Benkirane remains an influential figure in Moroccan politics and in his party.

During his time in the Soviet Union, he joined the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which was fighting against Portuguese colonial rule in Angola. \n\nPolitical career in Angola:\n\nAfter Angola gained independence in 1975, Dos Santos quickly rose within the MPLA, which became the ruling party in a war-torn Angola.  He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and later as Minister of Planning. \n\nPresidency:\n\nIn 1979, Dos Santos took power as president after the death of Agostinho Neto, Angola's first president and leader of the anti-colonial struggle.  During his presidency, Dos Santos had to navigate the turbulent times of the civil war pitting the MPLA against UNITA, which was supported by the United States and South Africa.  With the backing of Cuba and the Soviet Union, Dos Santos' government resisted UNITA's offensive. \n\nDuring his tenure, Angola experienced various phases of economic and political reform.  Initially, Dos Santos continued and strengthened the socialist policies of his predecessor, but with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of external support in the 1990s, he began implementing market reforms and opening the Angolan economy to foreign investment.  Angola's oil wealth played a crucial role in the country's recovery and economic growth, although the distribution of this wealth has often been questioned and marked by allegations of corruption and nepotism. \n\nIn 1992, Dos Santos was elected president in Angola's first multi-party elections, although the legitimacy of these elections was questioned and the country fell back into civil war until 2002. \n\nSince the end of the civil war, Dos Santos was criticized for his iron-fisted rule, the deterioration of freedom of expression, and the concentration of the country's wealth by his family and close associates.  His daughter, Isabel dos Santos, amassed a considerable fortune and became one of the symbols of the rich and powerful Angolan elite. \n\nRetirement and later life:\n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos announced his retirement in 2016 and handed over leadership of the MPLA to Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, who succeeded him as president in September 2017.  After leaving power, Dos Santos remained an important figure in Angolan politics.  His legacy continued to be debated, both for his role in stabilizing Angola after the civil war and for criticisms of corruption and challenges in wealth distribution in the country. \n\nDeath:\n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos passed away on July 8, 2022 in Barcelona, Spain, where he was receiving medical treatment, leaving behind an Angola still grappling with his economic and political legacy.

She is a Brazilian economist and politician who served as the 36th president of Brazil from January 1, 2011 until her impeachment on August 31, 2016, being the first woman to hold this position in Brazil. \n\nDilma is the daughter of a Bulgarian immigrant, Pedro Rousseff, and a Brazilian teacher, Dilma Jane da Silva.  She grew up in a middle-class environment and became involved in politics during her youth.  During the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964-1985), Rousseff participated in the resistance and left-wing political activities.  She was a member of several guerrilla groups that fought against the regime, including the National Liberation Command and the Armed Revolutionary Vanguard Palmares.  Due to her subversive activities, she was captured in 1970, tortured, and imprisoned for nearly three years. \n\nAfter her release, Rousseff continued her studies and graduated in economics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.  In the following years, she worked in various government positions in Rio Grande do Sul and at the federal level.  Establishing herself as an energy expert, she held various relevant positions related to the energy sector in the government. \n\nHer political career gained particular relevance when Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from the Workers' Party (PT), assumed the presidency of Brazil in 2003.  Rousseff joined Lula's government as Minister of Energy and later became his chief of staff in 2005.  In these positions, she stood out for her management and technical ability, earning Lula's trust. \n\nIn 2010, with the support of then-president Lula, Rousseff was the PT's candidate for the presidency of Brazil.  After a successful campaign, she won the election and took office in January 2011.  During her first term, she continued many of Lula's policies, focusing on poverty reduction programs, economic stabilization, and improvements in infrastructure. \n\nReelected in 2014 in a closely contested election, her second term was marked by an economic recession and a growing political crisis.  Rousseff was questioned for her handling of the economy and accusations of fiscal manipulation, known as \"fiscal maneuvers\" (accounting maneuvers to mask the budget deficit).  These events precipitated a political impeachment process that began in December 2015 and culminated in her impeachment in August 2016. \n\nDilma Rousseff's impeachment was controversial and sparked debate both in Brazil and the international community.  While some considered it a necessary measure in the face of fiscal violations and the economic crisis, others saw it as a parliamentary coup that interrupted the democratically elected mandate of a president. \n\nAfter her impeachment, Rousseff remains an active figure in Brazilian politics and a vocal critic of the government that succeeded her, still garnering support from a significant part of the population, especially among PT supporters and left-wing sectors.

His political career began in the 1980s, climbing positions within the PRI structure and holding various positions in the public administration of the State of Mexico. \n\nIn 2005, he was elected Governor of the State of Mexico, a position he held until 2011.  During his tenure, he focused on major infrastructure works and social programs, although he also faced criticism on security and transparency issues. \n\nIn 2012, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was elected President of Mexico as the PRI candidate, a party that returned to power after losing it in 2000 to the National Action Party (PAN).  His electoral victory was seen by many as the return of the \"old PRI\" through a young face and a modern, well-run campaign. \n\nHis presidency was marked by a series of structural reforms, collectively known as the \"Pact for Mexico,\" in sectors such as energy, education, telecommunications, and fiscal matters.  While these reforms were promoted as transformative, they also faced strong opposition and controversy, especially the energy reform, which opened the hydrocarbon sector to private investment. \n\nDuring his term, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was involved in several corruption scandals and conflicts of interest, including the case of the \"Casa Blanca,\" a luxury residence linked to his wife, actress Ang\u00e9lica Rivera, and acquired from a government contractor.  Additionally, his government faced severe issues of violence and insecurity, such as the disappearance of the 43 students from the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa in 2014, which led to massive protests and international criticism. \n\nThe end of his term was marked by low popularity, largely due to corruption scandals, security problems, and a perception of ineffectiveness in his public policies.  Despite his efforts to modernize the Mexican economy and promote an image of change, for many, he went down in history as a president who failed to break with the old vices of Mexican politics. \n\nAfter finishing his presidency in 2018, Pe\u00f1a Nieto kept a low profile, stepping back from active politics.  His successor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, promised to eradicate corruption and reverse some of the reforms undertaken during Pe\u00f1a Nieto's administration, reflecting the discontent of a significant portion of the Mexican population with his political legacy.

He began his political career in the government of Alfredo Palacio, where he served as Minister of Economy and Finance in 2005. \n\nCorrea was known for his leftist political stance and for being a staunch critic of neoliberalism and U. S.  influence in Latin America.  In 2006, he won the presidential elections with a campaign focused on proposals for change and political renewal, under the slogan of the \"Citizen Revolution. \" During his term, he promoted social welfare policies, investment in infrastructure and education, and greater state intervention in the economy. \n\nInternationally, he was one of the leaders of the Latin American integration movement and a co-founder of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).  He maintained close relations with other left-wing governments in the region, such as those of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and the Kirchners in Argentina. \n\nIn 2008, Correa convened a Constituent Assembly that resulted in the drafting of a new Constitution, which was approved by referendum.  The new Constitution granted more power to the state in the economy, recognized rights of nature, and sought to strengthen the democratic system and social policies. \n\nReelected in 2009 under the new constitution and again in 2013, Correa enjoyed a high level of popularity thanks to a significant increase in social spending and a period of stability and economic growth driven by high oil prices, the country's main export. \n\nHowever, his administration was also criticized, mainly for his handling of press freedom and allegations of authoritarianism.  His relationship with the media was tense, often accusing private media of being part of a right-wing opposition seeking to destabilize his government. \n\nCorrea decided not to run for reelection in 2017.

Of Aymara origin, Morales grew up in a family of subsistence farmers, which gave him an early awareness of the difficulties faced by indigenous people and peasants in Bolivia. \n\nIn his youth, Morales devoted himself to coca cultivation and was an active defender of coca farmers in the Chapare, a region in the department of Cochabamba.  In the 1980s, he emerged as a prominent union leader, taking over the leadership of the coca growers' union.  His activism put him in opposition to the Bolivian government and to policies backed by the United States for eradicating coca crops as part of the war on drugs. \n\nMorales began his political career in the early 1990s, co-founding the Movement for Socialism (MAS) in 1997, a political party that represents the interests of coca farmers and other indigenous and marginalized communities.  He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Congress in 1997, but was elected in 1998.  As a congressman, his focus on indigenous rights and his open criticism of neoliberal policies gained him recognition and support at the national level. \n\nIn 2002, Morales conducted a surprising presidential campaign and, although he lost, his party consolidated as an important political force in Bolivia.  Finally, in 2005, Evo Morales won the presidential elections with more than 50% of the votes, becoming the first indigenous president of the country and marking a historic milestone. \n\nDuring his presidential terms, Morales implemented a series of political, economic, and social reforms aimed at reducing inequality and strengthening the economy through the nationalization of important industries such as gas and oil.  He also promoted the inclusion of indigenous peoples in government and carried out the enactment of a new constitution in 2009 that recognized Bolivia as a plurinational state. \n\nMorales was reelected in 2009 and again in 2014.  However, his term was tarnished by accusations of authoritarianism and discontent over his decision to seek a fourth presidential term despite a referendum in 2016 that rejected amending the constitution to remove term limits. \n\nThe 2019 elections were engulfed in controversy due to allegations of electoral fraud.  After weeks of intense protests and after the armed forces suggested he resign, Morales resigned on November 10, 2019 and first went into exile in Mexico and then in Argentina. \n\nHis departure from power led Bolivia into a period of political instability, which culminated in new elections in 2020, where the candidate of his party, Luis Arce, won the presidency, allowing MAS to regain control of the government.  Morales returned to Bolivia after an interim government was in power and the accusations against him were dropped. \n\nEvo Morales remains a polarizing figure in Bolivia and Latin American politics, and is recognized for both his achievements in reducing poverty and defending indigenous peoples, as well as his inclination towards a centralized style of government and his resistance to relinquishing power after his presidential terms.

Known for his charismatic stage presence and his compas/kompa musical style, Martelly was one of the most popular artists in Haiti before entering politics. \n\nMartelly grew up in a middle-class family in Port-au-Prince.  He became interested in music at a young age and received a formal education at a local Catholic school before traveling to the United States to further his studies.  However, music was his true passion, and in the 1980s, he began performing professionally. \n\nBefore his political career, Martelly, popularly known as \"Sweet Micky,\" was a prominent figure in Haiti's music scene.  He started his musical career in the nightclubs of Port-au-Prince and gained popularity for his extravagant and often controversial performing style.  Throughout the 80s and 90s, Sweet Micky became famous for his energetic performances and his ability to captivate the audience. \n\nIn the political arena, Martelly entered the scene during a period of great instability for Haiti.  After the devastating 2010 earthquake that left the country in ruins, Haiti needed strong leadership.

His government had both accomplishments and criticisms; some saw him as a reformist and charismatic leader, while others accused him of authoritarianism and corruption. \n\nMartelly's tenure was also marked by a series of protests and political tensions, especially surrounding the parliamentary and presidential elections that were postponed several times, leading the country into a political crisis.  Despite some improvements in infrastructure and the promotion of tourism, his term ended without having resolved many of Haiti's endemic problems. \n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Martelly has remained relatively out of the political spotlight but continues to be a well-known figure in Haiti, both for his musical past and his presidential term.

After this action, he was imprisoned but later released under an amnesty agreement. \n\nIn 1956, Ra\u00fal was one of the 82 expeditionaries who traveled on the yacht Granma from Mexico to Cuba with the aim of overthrowing Batista.  He distinguished himself as an effective guerrilla commander in the Sierra Maestra and, by 1958, he commanded the Second Eastern Front \"Frank Pa\u00eds. \"\n\nAfter the triumph of the revolution in 1959, Ra\u00fal assumed important military and governmental roles.  Due to his military experience, he held the position of Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) for nearly five decades, earning considerable respect within the military apparatus and allowing him to modernize and professionalize the Cuban armed forces.  Additionally, he played a fundamental role in the direction and planning of military operations abroad, such as in Angola and Ethiopia. \n\nIn the political realm, Ra\u00fal was always seen as the right-hand man of his brother Fidel and an important member of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC).  In 1965, he was appointed its Second Secretary and has also held various responsibilities in the Cuban state as Vice Prime Minister. \n\nWith Fidel Castro's declining health, Ra\u00fal assumed the interim presidency of Cuba in 2006 and was officially appointed President of the Councils of State and Ministers in 2008.  During his presidency, he implemented a series of economic and social reforms aimed at updating the Cuban socialist model.  These included expanding the private sector, decentralizing state enterprise management, and encouraging foreign investment.  He was also responsible for a historic thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States, which culminated in the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2015 and the visit of U. S.  President Barack Obama to Cuba in 2016. \n\nIn April 2018, Ra\u00fal Castro stepped down from the presidency, paving the way for Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel to succeed him.  However, he continued to exert influence in the party and Cuban politics as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba until April 2021, when he announced his retirement and was succeeded by D\u00edaz-Canel in that position as well. \n\nRa\u00fal Castro's health has been the subject of speculation in recent years.  Although he no longer holds top public positions, his legacy as a key figure of the Cuban Revolution and leader of the country for over a decade will continue to be studied and discussed by those analyzing the contemporary history of Cuba.

He is known for having served as the president of Honduras for two consecutive terms, from January 27, 2014 to January 27, 2022. \n\nHern\u00e1ndez studied law at the National Autonomous University of Honduras and later obtained a master's degree in Public Administration from the State University of New York (SUNY) in Albany.  His political career began to take shape within the National Party of Honduras, one of the country's two main political parties. \n\nBefore becoming president, Hern\u00e1ndez held several important positions.  He was a congressman for Lempira in the National Congress since 1998 and became President of the National Congress between 2010 and 2013.  During his term, he promoted various reforms and laws, including some controversial ones such as the Public Finance Management, Exemptions Control and Anti-Evasion Measures Law in 2011, which aimed to improve the country's fiscal situation but was criticized by sectors that considered it contrary to the interests of the most vulnerable classes. \n\nIn the 2013 presidential elections, Hern\u00e1ndez won the presidency representing the National Party.  During his first term, he implemented tough policies against organized crime and gangs, which led to a significant reduction in the country's violence rates, although these policies were also criticized by human rights organizations due to accusations of abuses by security forces. \n\nHis presidency was also tainted by corruption allegations, especially related to the diversion of funds from the Honduran Social Security Institute to his presidential campaign, a scandal known as the IHSS case.  Despite this, in 2017, he was reelected in controversial elections that were followed by allegations of electoral fraud and violent protests. \n\nHern\u00e1ndez's reelection marked a controversial moment in the country's political history, as the Honduran Constitution explicitly prohibits presidential reelection.  However, in 2015, the Supreme Court of Justice of Honduras eliminated the article that prevented presidential reelection, which allowed Hern\u00e1ndez to run for a second term. \n\nDuring his second term, Hern\u00e1ndez continued with security policies and promoted investment for economic development, but he faced significant challenges such as high emigration of Hondurans to the United States, often fleeing poverty and violence. \n\nIn February 2023, Hern\u00e1ndez was arrested in Honduras at the request of the United States on charges of drug trafficking and using firearms in drug trafficking activities.  He was later extradited to the U. S.  to face these charges in the American judicial system. \n\nHern\u00e1ndez's political career was marked by advances in the fight against crime, but also by strong political polarization, social discontent demonstrations, and allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.

Coming from a wealthy family, Cartes became one of the most prominent businessmen in his country before entering the political arena. \n\nBusiness career:\nFrom a young age, Horacio Cartes showed skills for business.  He entered the business world through the family business and over time diversified his interests in various sectors, including banking, agriculture, livestock, tobacco, and beverage production. \n\nThrough his investments and companies, such as Banco Amambay and the tobacco company Tabesa, Cartes built a business conglomerate that granted him great economic influence in Paraguay.  His business success was also accompanied by controversies, including accusations of smuggling and money laundering, although he has consistently denied such claims. \n\nPolitical career:\nIn 2012, Horacio Cartes made a surprising turn in his career by announcing his intention to enter politics.  He joined the Colorado Party, one of the two traditional parties in Paraguay, and quickly positioned himself as a prominent figure within the party. \n\nIn the 2013 presidential elections, Cartes ran as a candidate for the Colorado Party and won, assuming the presidency of Paraguay on August 15, 2013 for a five-year term.  His administration focused on promoting foreign investment, improving infrastructure, and boosting agriculture and livestock, two pillars of the Paraguayan economy. \n\nHowever, his government was not without criticisms and controversies, including accusations of nepotism, corruption, and the lack of significant progress in reducing poverty and inequality.  One of the most controversial episodes of his presidency occurred in 2017 when an attempt was made to push for a constitutional amendment that would allow presidential re-election, which ultimately did not succeed following intense protests. \n\nLegacy:\nHoracio Cartes left the presidency in August 2018, being succeeded by Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez, also from the Colorado Party.  His legacy as president is mixed, with some recognizing his ability to attract investments and others criticizing his management for the outstanding issues in terms of transparency and social development. \n\nAfter his presidency, Cartes has continued to be an influential figure in Paraguayan politics, maintaining his power within his party and in the business landscape of his country.  In addition, he has had to face new investigations and accusations related to corruption and illicit activities, whose resolution is still ongoing. \n\nGiven that the political landscape can change rapidly, it is possible that Horacio Cartes' reputation and influence in Paraguay may evolve in the years to come.

He is known for being a prominent figure in Nicaraguan politics, especially as the leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) and President of Nicaragua in various periods. \n\nOrtega was raised in a working-class family, and his youth was marked by political activism.  He joined the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a guerrilla group that opposed the dictatorship of the Somoza family, which had ruled Nicaragua for decades. \n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, Ortega actively participated in the fight against the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, leading to his imprisonment on several occasions.  After his final release in 1974, he went into exile in Cuba and returned to Nicaragua shortly before the Sandinista victory. \n\nIn 1979, the FSLN managed to overthrow the dictator, and Ortega emerged as one of the members of the National Reconstruction Government Junta.  In 1984, Ortega was elected President of Nicaragua, leading the country during a period marked by the Sandinista Revolution, which involved profound social and economic reforms, as well as an armed conflict with the contras supported by the United States. \n\nHis first presidency lasted until 1990, when Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated him in the elections, largely due to the wear caused by the civil war and the economic pressures imposed by the United States. \n\nAfter losing power, Ortega continued to lead the FSLN and remained a central figure in the Nicaraguan opposition.  He failed in his attempts to return to the presidency in the elections of 1990, 1996, and 2001. \n\nFinally, in 2006, Daniel Ortega was reelected president, and since then he has been reelected in successive elections, although these elections have been widely criticized by the international community for their lack of transparency and the suppression of the opposition.  He has been accused of authoritarianism and of establishing a regime characterized by political repression and human rights violations. \n\nDuring his subsequent terms, Ortega has been criticized for concentrating power in the hands of his family and allies, repressing protests and media, and amending the Constitution to abolish presidential term limits.  The political situation in Nicaragua has generated tensions and international condemnations, particularly after the 2018 protests against his government, which resulted in severe repression and numerous deaths. \n\nDespite this, Ortega has maintained significant support among certain sectors of the Nicaraguan population, especially for the social assistance programs and macroeconomic stability that his administration has promoted during certain periods of his government.
