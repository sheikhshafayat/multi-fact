", "Mark Rutte": "Martin Luther (November 10, 1483 \u2013 February 18, 1546) was a 16th-century German theologian, monk, and religious reformer, and one of the key figures of the Protestant Reformation.  He advocated for fundamental changes within the Roman Catholic Church, and his ideas and actions led to the division of the church and the emergence of numerous new Christian denominations.  The following is a summary of Martin Luther's life and achievements. \n\n**Birth and Early Life:**\nMartin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Saxony, Germany.  His father, Hans Luther, was a miner who worked hard and eventually owned his own mine.  Martin grew up in a devout Catholic faith and entered university to study law as his parents wished. \n\n**Monastic Life:**\nIn 1505, after a near-death experience in a thunderstorm, Martin Luther vowed to dedicate his life to God and entered the Augustinian monastery.  There, he deeply studied the Bible and gained an excellent understanding of theology. \n\n**University of Wittenberg:**\nIn 1508, Luther was appointed as a theology professor at the University of Wittenberg.  There, he lectured on the Bible and immersed himself in theological work. \n\n**The Ninety-Five Theses:**\nOn October 31, 1517, Martin Luther posted 95 theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, criticizing the sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church.  This act publicly criticized the corruption and issues within the church, sparking debates and igniting the flames of the Reformation. \n\n**Conflict with the Church:**\nLuther's Ninety-Five Theses gained widespread attention across Europe, leading to controversies and debates.  The church and the emperor condemned Luther's teachings as heretical, but many people began to sympathize with and support his ideas. \n\n**Diet of Worms:**\nIn 1521, at the Diet of Worms, Luther refused to retract his writings when demanded to do so.  As a result, he was excommunicated by the emperor and condemned by the church. \n\n**Translation and Writings:**\nTo avoid arrest under the imperial ban, Luther sought refuge in Wartburg Castle and continued his important work.  He began translating the New Testament into German and later translated the Old Testament.  This German Bible played a significant role in standardizing the German language and making religion more accessible to the general public. \n\n**Spread of the Reformation:**\nLuther's teachings had an impact not only in Germany but also across Europe.  He published various theological and religious works, laying the foundation for Protestant faith.  Luther provided innovative views on the relationship between church and state, forms of worship, education, and family life. \n\n**Later Years and Death:**\nMartin Luther spent his final years in his birth city of Eisleben, strengthening and expanding various aspects of the Reformation.
