His presidency lasted until 2018 and was also tainted by a series of scandals and allegations of corruption.  For example, he was criticized for using state funds to upgrade his personal estate in Nkandla and his connections to the wealthy Gupta family, which allegedly wielded significant influence over political appointments and state contracts. \n\nUnder mounting pressure, including from within his own party, the ANC, Zuma announced his resignation on February 14, 2018, making way for his deputy and the new ANC leader, Cyril Ramaphosa.

During the war for independence (1954-1962), he was one of the young army officers.  After independence, he held several government positions, including Minister of Youth and Sports, and later Minister of Foreign Affairs. \n\nDue to his experience in foreign policy and his closeness to then-President Houari Boumediene, Bouteflika became one of the country's leading political figures.  He helped strengthen Algeria's international position, for example, through diplomatic support for independence movements in Africa and active participation in the Non-Aligned Movement. \n\nAfter Boumediene's death and the appointment of Chadli Bendjedid as president, Bouteflika withdrew from politics and even left Algeria for several years after facing corruption allegations. \n\nReturning to politics in the mid-1990s, he won the presidential election in 1999.
